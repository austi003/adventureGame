adventureGame
=============

Text based RPG game done primarily in JavaScript to reinforce Functions, Loops, Objects, etc. Using HTML/CSS for display along w/ jQuery. 

I'm relatively new to JavaScript and have been following along in the CodeAcademy tutorials. I decided to make my own 
text based RPG game that will make use of Functions, Objects, While loops, For loops, etc. 

As I progress through the project I'm graying out large chunks of my code with comments - /* */ so that I can quickly test 
just the part I'm working on. 

If you decide to pull my code to run it, just look through and remember to remove any comments


FILE STRUCTURE:
codeNinja_action.js   -  This file will have any functions created in JavaScript that controls behavior 
codeNinja_objects.js  -  This file will create all of the objects used in my game
codeNinja_jQuery.js   -  This file will hold all of my jQuery code
