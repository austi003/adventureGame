=============

Text based RPG game done in JavaScript to reinforce Functions, Loops, Objects, etc.

I'm relatively new to JavaScript and have been following along in the CodeAcademy tutorials. I decided to make my own 
text based RPG game that will make use of Functions, Objects, While loops, For loops, etc. 

As I progress through the project I'm graying out large chunks of my code with comments - /* */ so that I can quickly test 
just the part I'm working on. 

If you decide to pull my code to run it, just look through and remmeber to remove any comments
